# Sentiment analysis 
In this project I'm analysing the overall sentiment of Amazon products. 

### Content: 
1. The imported libraries used to analyse the dataset. 
2. We introduce the dataframe using an .csv file and print the head (first 5 entries of the dataframe), just to make sure it is working
3. Select the column we want to work with, in this case 'reviews.text'
4. Clean process of the df
5. removing poctuation and null values
6. Then we preprocess the df
7. Analysis of the sentiment
8. We look for similarities

### Installing your project locally 

I downloaded the Github app whch makes it easier for me to access my reportories and upload the projects that I'm working.  

### Instructions on how to use your project once installed. 
An example on how to modify and commit changes to you work below : 
 1. Create your repo and add a code script
 2. Add you file name
 3. Dowload your git and choose your work space 
 4. Make sure git is installed by writting get init in your terminal
 5. Create your code file
 6. Once done you can type your code
 7. In the terminal type git status to see the code file and if any changes have been commit (if none have been made it will display : 'No commits yet')
 8. From this point if any changes are made then the system will not track the changes, to track the changes made you need to add the file.
    So, on your teminal you need to type : git add file_name.py     (ENTER)
                                           git status               (ENTER)
    The terminal will display : new file : file_name.py             (In green this time)
    Once this is done, we will be able to track the changes done to the code.
 9. If we change the code and type git statuts in the terminal, we can see again that the change has not been committed 
 10. To commit the change and to keep a track on what has been done, in the terminal again
                                          git commit -m 'Give it a title (eg. 'Change 1')                 (ENTER)
                                          git status
     And we can see that the change has been made and is been tracked.

(You will be able to find screenshots with the whole process in this repo :) )
